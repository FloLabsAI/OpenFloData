# Volve Dataset License

This project uses production data derived from the **Volve field dataset** released by Equinor.

## About the Volve Dataset

The Volve field dataset contains daily production data from the Volve field in the North Sea (2007-2016). Equinor released this comprehensive dataset to support research, education, and technology development.

## Data Processing

The original Volve dataset provides **daily production data**. For this project, the data has been **synthetically upsampled to hourly intervals** while preserving:
- General statistical distribution of the original data
- Physics and thermodynamics constraints of oil production systems

This upsampling creates a realistic simulation of real-time production data suitable for demonstrating streaming systems.
